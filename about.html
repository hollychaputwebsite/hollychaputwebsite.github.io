						<div class="regular-text">
							Holly Chaput Channell has been making music since she was just 10 years old. Whether singing, songwriting, playing guitar or playing drums, Holly has always been active in the creative elements. Holly currently holds a B.A. in Music with an emphasis in Drum Set and Jazz Studies and a Master of Music degree in Jazz Performance from Arizona State University. Her first E.P in the singer-songwriter genre, Save Me was released on all musical platforms in August of 2014 and is currently self producing a new body of singer-songwriter works, and will be in the studio recording her first headlining jazz trio album! Throughout her studies Holly has had the opportunity to study privately with Kobie Watkins and Lewis Nash, and accumulate a creative mentorship with pianist Mike Kocour, trumpeter Jason Palmer, saxophonist Roxy Coss and bassist Rufus Reid. Along with teaching a private studio of students, she also works with the non-Profit organization Phoenix Jazz Girls Rising based in Phoenix, Arizona where she helps mentor young female identifying musicians as they start their path in the jazz world. She works in higher education as an adjunct faculty member at South Mountain Community College and as a Teaching Artist at Phoenix Conservatory of Music. Holly also holds Rhythm Clinic Masterclasses where she engages in social activism through music by introducing musical concepts to the next generation who may not have the opportunity to learn music otherwise.
							<br><br>
							Holly has played with some amazing musicians in her career so far including pianists Benny Green and Mike Kocour, saxophonists Damani Phillips and Ed Calle (with his quartet The Miami Saxophone Quartet), the FOUR saxophone Quartet, trumpeters Brad Goode and Jason Palmer, the Kobie Watkins Grouptet and many other incredible artists. She works with different trad jazz groups performing at the Arizona Classic Jazz Festival, and the Jazz Women Collective which is a group of female identifying musicians who advocate for Women in Jazz by playing and performing works by all female jazz composers. She also plays with the Phoenix Gay Men’s Chorus with the focus on advocating for, and educating the community on LGBTQ+ issues. She has toured nationally and internationally both with a symphony band as a percussionist and as a big band drummer. In 2023 Holly was named a 2023 Sister in Jazz by the Jazz Education Network and got to work under the direction of bassist Marion Hayden at the 2023 JEN Conference in Orlando. Along with being a musician and activist, she is a loving mother to a wonderful baby daughter, a wife to a wonderful and supportive husband and enjoys her time with family and friends.
